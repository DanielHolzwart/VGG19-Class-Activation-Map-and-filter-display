# VGG19-Class-Activation-Map-and-filter-display

In this workbook, we will apply the Class Activation Function (=CAM) to a picture of dogs. CAM lets us see at pictures through the eyes of a convolutional neural network and highlights the parts of the picture which are most prudant to classify a picture. Phrased differently, we want to see the dogs in the picture below highlighted in red.

Moreover, extended the model class we add the functionality to extract features and convolutional layers from the model to display filters.
